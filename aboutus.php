<h3 class="title-bg">The History</h3>
<p>In early 2000, commercial football tournaments were on the rise in Bengaluru. Playing football in competitive leagues & tournaments for a prize had set a trend. Riding that wave, a bunch of youngsters took up an initiative to organise and host footballing events, hence providing a platform to everyone who would compete in a fair, lively & encouraging way. </p>
<p>This made them realise the universal truth: that like in most countries, Football had the power to unite & bring people together from different walks of life. What began as a fun project then, has taken a more optimised form as Soccer Intimacy.</p>

                            <h3 class="title-bg">The Journey</h3>
<p>In 2016, we became a legitimate brand before which the members of our management team have hosted events & collaborations under many different identities. Since nothing engages a crowd more than live sport, our events have always received positive attention & support from many fans, followers & friends. This initialised a form & system for everyone to identify the need for football in our lives, which today is called Soccer Intimacy.</p>
<p>Our founding members have been involved in the football scene all across Bengaluru, from owning the first all natural football turf in the city called 'The Hub Soccer Mania, Whitefield' to hosting the most consecutive run amateur football tournament called The BEML Premier League. Over the years, the only primary thought among all of us have been proven to be:</p>

                                 <p>At Soccer Intimacy, everybody believes that Football has the power to engage everyone at different levels. From hosting tournaments in housing complexes to larger intercity apartments, we literally stand by what we preach when we say 'United By Football'. We've hosted a wide range of small scale events & brought out the best of those who've participated. Often positioning football as a sport, we believe it isn't just for the big players but an exercise that can easily be adapted for adding leisure to life, injecting competitiveness or to simply encourage team spirit among people. 'United By Football' is our main objective because we envision a future where everyone in the country comes together in support of this wonderful sport.</p>

                                <p>Being the IT city of India as well as one of the rising start-up hubs in the country, Bengaluru has drones of people working round the clock without any amount of basic physical activity. Through Soccer Intimacy, we aim to provide a 360 degree solution through our 'Corporate Events' mandate to help employees ease off their monotony & experience a fun, thrilling game of Football! We have conducted events in various corporate firms across the city & received a massive reception from them. After fully understanding & realising the impact a game of football has over an employee's energy levels, enthusiasm, team-building, co-ordination & social well-being, we have added this mandate to our primary objectives. </p>

                                <p>Football inspires competitiveness across the globe & it always will. Since 2011, we've been perfecting the art of successfully hosting events that bring out a healthy competition amongst players who are part of our world, hence giving them an outlet to unleash their physical capabilities in the game, in a responsible manner. We're well aware that it's a thin tricky line between competitiveness & aggressiveness. Keeping that reality in mind, we do evoke the spirit of the game in our players & spectators that's like no other in the city! Our collaboration with professional referees & management from BFC Bengaluru Football Club has led us to successfully organise & manage complex quarterly tournaments. This definitely helps us be a treat to Football lovers as well as pose a challenge to other football organisers, since we're constantly in pursuit to be better than our past</p>
